# Assignment 1:

* ## Why did you choose this item to include in your portfolio?

    There are some reasons that I include this for my portfolio. First, I really like coding and Assignment 1 is the very first coding assignment in this class. Next, this assignment left me some feelings as an incomplete task because it's just a introducing assignment to Mathplotlib. Last but not least, this is also a practice and improvement for the project as I can use these improvement to leverage my project.

* ## What did you learn from doing this activity/assignment? If you learned nothing, what kind of activity/assignment would facilitate learning for you instead? 

    I learned many things from this assignment. One of them is coding experience, among Programming Languages as I know, Python is the least I use. Therefore, by doing this assignment, I sharpen my Pythonic spirit. Also, I learned how to use Jupyter Notebook, especially, Jupyter Notebook in Visual Studio code.

* ## How might you use these concepts/techniques outside of class (in your research, daily life, job, hobby, etc.)?

    I am working in an internship that use Java as the backend and a lot of Python scripts as auxiliary tools for testing and generating informations, so this is absolutely helpful in many ways.

* ## Anything that sparked your curiosity, or other interesting revelations?

    There is a thing that still makes me curious, that is how to embed html Jupyter Notebook to an other html file while it is still interactively working. I have tried couple of methods but they seemed not working. Therefore, I think this is in my to-do list for now.

# Activity 2:

* ## Why did you choose this item to include in your portfolio?

    I chose this activity because it is the one of the very first activity that helps me understand how to construct a proper visualization based on analised task. 

* ## What did you learn from doing this activity/assignment? If you learned nothing, what kind of activity/assignment would facilitate learning for you instead? 

    Task abstraction was the thing I learned from this assignment. This is like a compass for me for later in this course. I am able to identify tasks and activities for my coding part in the project thank to this activity.

* ## How might you use these concepts/techniques outside of class (in your research, daily life, job, hobby, etc.)?

    Many people think this is only used in the visualizating tasks, but it is very convenient for me in my coding passion. As many people may know, there is a definition of **class** or **object** in programming. They behave just like real-life object For example, a car can be used to drive but not to fly. Therefore, applying the same priciple of task abstraction, I can identify the **object's functionalities**.

* ## Anything that sparked your curiosity, or other interesting revelations?

    For this activity, I really have nothing to concern or notice. However, this is a good activity.
